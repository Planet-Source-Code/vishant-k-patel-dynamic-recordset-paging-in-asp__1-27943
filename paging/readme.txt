Dear ASP Lovers,

In development of dynamic website using ASP, recordset paging is one of the very useful feature. This code "Dynamic Paging in ASP" makes the recordset paging a child's play. You just have to modify three parameters in the paging.asp file and voila, you can use this code anywhere in you website. Just gives the name of database file, name of table and no. of records to display. That's it ! I am sure it will be a very handy code for any serious ASP Developer.

Share this folder at your webserver and have a look at it by opening the page http://yourwebserver/paging/paging.asp

Comments and Suggestions are welcome :)
